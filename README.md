## Dumpster Fire

This is a continuation of my old project from [Java](https://github.com/WWelna/Crypto-Java/) that implemented lesser known, uncommon, obscure, and insecure cryptology algorithms of every kind. I don't work with Java anymore and won't be in the foreseeable future, so I decided to continue in zig and expand it along with various old obscure compression algorithms.
